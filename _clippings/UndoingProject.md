Excerpts from [*The Undoing Project*](https://smile.amazon.com/Undoing-Project-Friendship-Changed-Minds-ebook/dp/B01GI6S7EK/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1484559308&sr=1-1&keywords=the+undoing+project)

A lot of things that most human beings would never think to do, to Amos simply made sense. For instance, when he wanted to go for a run he . . . went for a run. No stretching, no jogging outfit or, for that matter, jogging: He’d simply strip off his slacks and sprint out his front door in his underpants and run as fast as he could until he couldn’t run anymore. “Amos thought people paid an enormous price to avoid mild embarrassment,” said his friend Avishai Margalit, “and he himself decided very early on it was not worth it.”

“For him the main thing is the people who don’t know the difference between knowing and not knowing,” says Avishai Margalit.

But Amos approached intellectual life strategically, as if it were an oil field to be drilled, and after two years of sitting through philosophy classes he announced that philosophy was a dry well. “I remember his words,” recalled Amnon. “He said, ‘There is nothing we can do in philosophy. Plato solved too many of the problems. We can’t have any impact in this area. There are too many smart guys and too few problems left, and the problems have no solutions.’”

“It’s hard to know how people select a course in life,” Amos said. “The big choices we make are practically random. The small choices probably tell us more about who we are. Which field we go into may depend on which high school teacher we happen to meet. Who we marry may depend on who happens to be around at the right time of life. On the other hand, the small decisions are very systematic. That I became a psychologist is probably not very revealing. What kind of psychologist I am may reflect deep traits.”

One unlikely survivor is a single scrap of paper with a few badly typed words on it, drawn from conversations he had with Danny in the spring of 1972 as they neared the end of their time in Eugene. For some reason Amos saved it: 
People predict by making up stories 
People predict very little and explain everything 
People live under uncertainty whether they like it or not 
People believe they can tell the future if they work hard enough 
People accept any explanation as long as it fits the facts 
The handwriting was on the wall, it was just the ink that was invisible 
People often work hard to obtain information they already have 
And avoid new knowledge 
Man is a deterministic device thrown into a probabilistic Universe 
In this match, surprises are expected 
Everything that has already happened must have been inevitable
<hr>


No one saw what Danny saw: that the pilots would have tended to do better after an especially poor maneuver, or worse after an especially great one, if no one had said anything at all. Man’s inability to see the power of regression to the mean leaves him blind to the nature of the world around him. We are exposed to a lifetime schedule in which we are most often rewarded for punishing others, and punished for rewarding.

All too often, we find ourselves unable to predict what will happen; yet after the fact we explain what did happen with a great deal of confidence. This “ability” to explain that which we cannot predict, even in the absence of any additional information, represents an important, though subtle, flaw in our reasoning. It leads us to believe that there is a less uncertain world than there actually is, and that we are less bright than we actually might be. For if we can explain tomorrow what we cannot predict today, without any added information except the knowledge of the actual outcome, then this outcome must have been determined in advance and we should have been able to predict it. The fact that we couldn’t is taken as an indication of our limited intelligence rather than of the uncertainty that is in the world. All too often, we feel like kicking ourselves for failing to foresee that which later appears inevitable. For all we know, the handwriting might have been on the wall all along. The question is: was the ink visible?
<hr>


It wasn’t that what first came to mind was always wrong; it was that its existence in your mind led you to feel more certain than you should be that it was correct.
<hr>


As Kahneman and Tversky long ago had pointed out, a person who is making a prediction—or a diagnosis—is allowed to ignore base rates only if he is completely certain he is correct.
