Excerpts from [*A Trackless Path*](https://smile.amazon.com/Trackless-Path-Ken-McLeod/dp/0989515346/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1484559417&sr=1-1&keywords=trackless+path)

```
Any notion of practice clouds the heart of the matter.
```
<hr>

```
Rest in what you experience right now.
 
When you give up your reactive checking, 
Managing and goal-seeking — all of it — 
There is a direct knowing, open and free. 
Stop changing or altering it. Rest right there.

Then, when conceptual thinking arises, 
Don’t look at what arises: be what knows the arising.
Like an oak peg in hard ground, 
Stand firm in awareness that knows, 
And go deep into the mystery.
```
<hr>

Practice does not change mind itself but it can and does interrupt, disrupt, wear away or break down the operation of reactive patterns and open the possibility of recognizing mind itself. Practice also builds the capacity in the clear, stable attention needed to stay in touch with mind itself once it has been recognized.

Morality provides groups with cohesion — a set of shared values and priorities that determine with whom we do or do not connect. ... 

This cohesive function inevitably leads members of a given group to diminish or dismiss the values and priorities of other groups. Conflicting ideas about right and wrong and about what is true become the seeds of tension and conflict — conflicts that are resolved or fought out in the political, economic and social spheres. Hence, as the Korean monk Manhae wrote in *Everything Yearned For*:

```
Yes, I understand ethics, morality, law
are nothing but the smoke worshipping the sword and gold.
```

This function of morality with its attendant concern for belonging and reputation is in stark contrast to the ethics of Mahayana Buddhism, in which we find guidelines such as this one from *Mind Training in Eight Verses*:

```
When scorn and insult become my lot,
Expressions of some jealousy,
I alone accept defeat
And award the other victory.
```

This and similar guidelines serve a third and very different function. They support and reinforce the efforts we make in practice. To this end, they replace the external enemy with an internal enemy, our own reactivity. Victory over an external enemy is replaced by victory over the internal enemy, our ordinary reactive impulses. Ethical guidelines in this context are not about right and wrong per se, though they are often interpreted that way. Nor are they about the values of a group or community, though they have often been corrupted for that purpose. They are, instead, guidelines for practice, for a practice that has nothing to do with living in society but has everything to do with freeing oneself from the grip of reactive emotions and the habituated patterns developed through social interaction.
