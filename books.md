Here's a list of the books I've read since leaving the states:

1. [__Seven Brief Lessons on Physics__](https://smile.amazon.com/Seven-Brief-Lessons-Physics-Rovelli/dp/0399184414/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1484287159&sr=8-1&keywords=seven+brief+lessons+on+physics), Carlo Rovelli
* Rovelli writes beautifully. His final chapter — on the way humans might fit into the world-picture of physics — deserves the widest possible readership.
1. [__The Story of the Lost Child__](https://smile.amazon.com/Neapolitan-Novels-Elena-Ferrante-Boxed-ebook/dp/B00YBA7QAC/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1486200185&sr=8-5&keywords=neapolitan+novels), Elena Ferrante
1. [__The Path__](https://smile.amazon.com/Path-Chinese-Philosophers-Teach-About-ebook/dp/B00P42X0WE/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1484559509&sr=1-1&keywords=the+path), Michael Puett & Christine Gross-Loh 
* Puett teaches a ["life changing"](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/10/why-are-hundreds-of-harvard-students-studying-ancient-chinese-philosophy/280356/) survey course in Chinese thought at Harvard, and frequently [lectures](http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1179221.files/SELF%20SERENITY%202013%20SYLLABUS.pdf) with Roberto Unger. While his views on ritual and the West's misunderstanding of Confucian thought are fascinating and the courses may change lives, the book will only waste your time. Here the philosophically unfamiliar makes contact with the everyday only to explode, page after page, into utter banality: "Think of who is most effective in the workplace" — the good person, or the bully? (It's the latter. The preceeding paragraph begins: "Think of Rosa Parks...").
* I read this while passing through China at 90MPH, unable to sleep on a bed three feet long in an overnight sleeper bus that never had more than half its wheels on the ground. Charity is a finite resource. 
1. [__The Three-Body Problem__](https://smile.amazon.com/Three-Body-Problem-Remembrance-Earths-Past-ebook/dp/B00IQO403K/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1484559485&sr=1-1&keywords=three+body+problem), Liu Cixin
1. [__Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism__](https://smile.amazon.com/Cutting-Spiritual-Materialism-Shambhala-Classics-ebook/dp/B00HQM20NK/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1484559449&sr=1-1&keywords=cutting+through+spiritual+materialism), Chögyam Trungpa

1. [__A Trackless Path__](https://smile.amazon.com/Trackless-Path-Ken-McLeod/dp/0989515346/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1484559417&sr=1-1&keywords=trackless+path), Ken McLeod
* If you're going to read one dzogchen commentary, this is the one.

1. [__In the Light of What We Know__](https://smile.amazon.com/Light-What-We-Know-Novel/dp/1250062373/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1484559378&sr=1-1), Zia Haider Rahman
* [Excerpts]({{ site.baseurl }}/clippings/LightWhat)
1. [__Food Rules__](https://smile.amazon.com/Food-Rules-Eaters-Michael-Pollan-ebook/dp/B002YJK5L4/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1484559337&sr=1-1&keywords=food+rules), Michael Pollan
1. [__The Undoing Project__](https://smile.amazon.com/Undoing-Project-Friendship-Changed-Minds-ebook/dp/B01GI6S7EK/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1484559308&sr=1-1&keywords=the+undoing+project), Michael Lewis
* The most accessible summary of Kahneman and Tversky's research, i.e. a treasure map on sale in every airport. The implications of their work for human (self-)understanding are practically without limit. 
* [Excerpts]({{ site.baseurl }}/clippings/UndoingProject), pruned and from only the first 1/3rd or so (!) of the book. And thanks to Brinkley for the recommendation. 
1. [__Tetralogue__](https://smile.amazon.com/Tetralogue-Im-Right-Youre-Wrong/dp/0198728883?ie=UTF8&keywords=tetralogue&qid=1484559275&ref_=sr_1_1&sr=8-1), Timothy Williamson
* The author recently published [an essay](http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/35832/TLS.pdf) about the sorry state of "pop philosophy". He's also the foremost proponent of the "epistemic" account of vagueness, which holds there are a *knowable* number of hairs a bald man is missing, such that replacing them hair by hair, in just the right spots, would render him non-bald. I hope the tension is obvious, and *pop* philosophy may not be the problem. 
* I enjoyed the book! 
1. [__The Conquest of Happiness__](https://smile.amazon.com/Conquest-Happiness-Bertrand-Russell/dp/087140673X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1484475252&sr=8-1&keywords=the+conquest+of+happiness), Bertrand Russell
* Antiquated, perennial, a time capsule that could  have been filled by no one else.
